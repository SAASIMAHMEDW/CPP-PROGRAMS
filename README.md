1. Agastya is currently standing at stair 00 and he wants to reach stair numbered XX.
Agastya can climb either YY steps or 11 step in one move.
Find the minimum number of moves required by him to reach exactly the stair numbered XX.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two space separated integers XX 
and YY denoting the number of stair Agastya wants to reach and the number of stairs he can 
climb in one move.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of moves required by him to reach exactly 
the stair numbered XX.

2. You are given the height H (in metres) and mass M (in kilograms). The Body Mass Index 
(BMI) of a person is computed as 𝑀
𝐻2
.
Report the category into which a person falls, based on his BMI:
• Category 1: Underweight if 𝐵𝑀𝐼 ≤ 18
• Category 2: Normal weight if𝐵𝑀𝐼 ∈ {19, 20, … , 24}
• Category 3: Overweight if 𝐵𝑀𝐼 ∈ {25, 26, … , 29}
• Category 4: Obesity if 𝐵𝑀𝐼 ≥ 30
Input:
The first line of input will contain an integer, TT, which denotes the number of testcases. 
Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, with two space separated integers, M, H, which 
denote the mass and height of Agastya respectively.
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, 1, 2, 31,2,3 or 44, based on the category in which 
Agastya falls.

3. You will be given an array of N integers and you have to print the integers in the reverse 
order.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains N, where N is the number of integers. The next line 
contains N space-separated integers.
